## BM

collaboration network by Daria Maltseva

## HSE

Example network used at HSE December 4, 2018 to explain the basic Pajek's network description format.

## Bib

bibNodes.csv and bibLinks.csv provide an example, used at the EUSN 2016 workshop, of description of a network with two tables - one describing the nodes and the other describing the links.
bib.paj and bib.json are examples of conversion of these two files into Pajek and json format.
 
## Tribes

**Tribes** is social network of tribes of the Gahukuâ€“Gama alliance structure of the Eastern Central Highlands of New Guinea, from Kenneth Read [Cultures of the Central Highlands, New Guinea](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3629074.pdf)(1954). A link represents signed (+/-) friendships between tribes. Converted into Pajek format by Vladimir Batagelj, 14 Feb 2025
